# Playground

This is @realJema *playground* with react to learn how it works and t work on some interesting projects. 


### Learning React 
#### Book: Pro React 
> *Build Complex front-end Applications in a composable way with React*

React is an engine for building composable user interfaces using JavaScript and (optionally) XML.


##### package.json
A **package.json** file. The package.json is a standard npm manifest file
that holds various information about the project, such a name, description,
information about the author, etc. It lets the developer specify dependencies
(that can get automatically downloaded and installed) and define script tasks

##### Props
A key factor to make components reusable and composable is the ability to configure them, Props are the mechanism used in React for passing data from parent to child components.
syntax:   
```
this.props.<name>
```

they can't be changed by the child, they are owned by the parent. 

##### State
React’s components can have mutable data inside this.state.
state is limited to the component where it is defined and props can only be passed from parent to child, thats why we need frameworks like **redux**, to permit communication in the reverse direction and across children components 

 a component’s internal state is kept to minimum because every time the state changes, the
component is rendered again.

##### Events 
Touch and Mouse Events
----------------------------------------------------------

| onTouchStart | onTouchMove | onTouchEnd | onTouchCancel| onClick | onDoubleClick | onMouseDown | onMouseUp | onMouseOver| onMouseMove | onMouseEnter | onMouseLeave | onMouseOut | onContextMenu| onDrag | onDragEnter | onDragLeave | onDragExit | onDragStart| onDragEnd | onDragOver | onDrop

Keyboard Events
-------------------------------------------------------------

| onKeyDown | onKeyUp | onKeyPress

Focus and Form Events
-------------------------------------------------------------

| onFocus | onBlur| onChange | onInput | onSubmit

Other Events
----------------------------------------------------------

| onScroll | onWheel | onCopy | onCut | onPaste

##### Conditions 
Tenary expressions 
syntax: 
```
    <div>
        {condition ?
            <span>Hello JSX</span>
        : 
            <span>Not Hello JSX</span>
        }
    </div>
```
External definition 
```
render() {
    let result;
    if(condition){
        result = "salutation";
    }
    return (
        <div>
            {result}
        </div>
    )
}
```

##### Forms 
Controlled Components 
A form component with a value or checked prop is called a controlled component. In a controlled component, the value rendered inside the element will always reflect the value of the prop. By default the user won’t be able to change it

Uncontrolled Components
Controlled components adhere to React’s principles and have their advantages. While uncontrolled components are an anti-pattern for how most other components are constructed in React, sometimes you don’t need to oversee the user input field by field

##### Keys
 Keys are unique identifiers that allow for fast lookups
between trees for finding insertions, deletions, substitutions, and moves. Every time you create components
in a loop, it’s a good idea to provide a key for each child in order to help the React Library match and avoid
performance bottlenecks.

##### Refs 
Refs can be used as a string prop on any component, like so:
```
<input ref="myInput" />
```
The referenced DOM markup can then be accessed via this.refs, like so:
```
let input = this.refs.myInput;
let inputValue = input.value;
let inputRect = input.getBoundingClientRect();
```
